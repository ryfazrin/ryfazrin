### Hi, welcome 👋
I'm Muhammad Pazrin Andreanor.

🌱 I started programming using php. Typing something in front of the computer makes me addicted to doing it. I used to be a person who was afraid to try new things. 3 years I just played the standard features in php. now i play a website server language in Codeigniter 4, or in Laravel.

⚡ tried the front-end framework, I really like the JavaScript syntax especially Reactjs. React is easy to read and easy to understand for me.

🤔 I'm trying to do a little bit of trouble in the native app section 😄. It amazed me. Java which is transformed into kotlin without a semicolon, it presents shortcodes. or Flutter with simple and easy UI writing for multiplatform.

I like all of this. ❤

- 🙌 PHP, JavaScript, Java, Kotlin, Dart
- 🍟 Codeigniter, Laravel, React, TypeScript, Flutter
- 🍔 Tailwindcss, Material-Design
